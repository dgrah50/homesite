I often fall into the trap of getting excited about _something new_ and diving head first into solving a problem. I read all the great things about what $NEW_SOLUTION can do, but sometimes I don't stick around long enough to find the rough edges of $NEW_SOLUTION. As I gain more and more experience as a professional, I've come to realise 
that much like fashion, technology seems to come around in cycles. Whilst there is innovation, old ideas and concepts are here to stay - and if we don't learn from past mistakes, we are doomed to repeat them. Rather than hopping on the new latest hype, I now realise the value in learning one or two languages extremely well. With the advent of AI, getting to a level of productivity in a new language is easier than ever. What is most important to me at this time is understanding a _concept_ in one base language (or even pseudolanguage!) and then being to translate that thought into whatever language I happen to be working in. I think at this time, if you don't have enough depth in one language, then the _thoughts_ that you are able to have are somewhat limited.
