A hobby is defined as:

> an activity done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure.

I was having a debate whether hanging out with your friends is a hobby or not. On one hand, a traditional hobby tends to have tangible and measurable outcomes and for me, when I am really into a hobby, I pick it apart and study how to get better at it. Is that possible to do with the hobby of hanging out ? Is that criteria even necessary for a hobby?
