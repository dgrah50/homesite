As I get older, I realise how much of my online education I owe to RuneScape. The basics of avoiding online scams, the awareness of supply and demand effects on a market and the need to invest time to achieve goals. All by the age of about 10, I had been gifted so much by this legendary game. Years after I have finished playing the game, there's a nod of respect and instant kinship whenever someone mentions that they also played.
