Man, the older I get, the more I realize how much RuneScape shaped my online smarts. It's wild to think about, but that game was basically my crash course in internet street smarts and life skills.

Take online scams, for instance. RuneScape was like Scam Prevention 101. (shout out to those "armor trimming" scammers). Those basically taught me to keep my eyes peeled and not trust everyone the internet. Honestly, it's a lesson that's only gotten more crucial as we've dived deeper into the digital age.

And then there's the economics lessons. The Grand Exchange was basically my first taste of how markets work. Watching item prices go nuts because of some in-game event was like a mini stock market simulation. Without even realizing it, I was picking up on supply and demand concepts that some folks don't grasp until way later.

But you know what really sticks with me? The grind. RuneScape didn't hand you anything on a silver platter. Want that sweet level 99 in a skill? Better buckle up for the long haul. It was all about setting goals and putting in the work. Little did I know I was learning patience and perseverance while I was clicking away.

The craziest part? I was soaking all this up when I was just a kid, maybe 10 or so. Talk about a head start.

Even now, years after I've hung up my dragon armor, RuneScape's still with me. It's like this secret handshake - you meet someone who played, and boom, instant connection. There's this unspoken understanding, like "Yeah, you get it."

Looking back, RuneScape wasn't just some game I sank hours into. It was like training wheels for life, getting me ready for all the crazy stuff the internet age would throw at me. Pretty cool for a game about clicking on trees and fighting goblins, right?
