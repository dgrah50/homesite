## Magic Table

### What is it?

A coffee table with a built-in TV and mid-air gestures to control it.

### More Info

The Magic Table was inspired by a combination of a school project table and a Raspberry Pi lying around the house. It incorporates a TV inside the table and uses a Pimoroni Skywriter for mid-air gesture control. Inspired by the iPod Classic, the table uses circular motions to control volume. The display includes news, weather, Premier League updates, and cryptocurrency prices.
