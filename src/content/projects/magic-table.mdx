The Magic Table was inspired by a combination of a school project table and a Raspberry Pi lying around the house. It incorporates a TV inside the table and uses a Pimoroni Skywriter for mid-air gesture control. Inspired by the iPod Classic, the table uses circular motions to control volume. The display includes news, weather, Premier League updates, and cryptocurrency prices.

The Magic Table is a project that merges everyday furniture with some interesting tech. At its core, it features a Raspberry Pi that powers a high-definition touchscreen display. This setup allows for a variety of applications, from displaying information to controlling smart home devices.

One of the key aspects of the Magic Table is its use of the MagicMirror² platform. This open-source modular framework is typically used for smart mirrors, but I repurposed it to create a customizable interface for the table. It allows me to display real-time data like news, weather, and even social media updates, all in a modular format that can be tailored to my needs.

The gesture control is another fun feature. Using a Pimoroni Skywriter, I implemented mid-air gesture recognition, which lets users navigate the interface without touching the screen. This adds a layer of interactivity that feels quite futuristic, even if it’s just swiping to change the news feed.

The Raspberry Pi serves as the brain of the operation, handling all the processing and connectivity. It’s a great little device that can run the necessary software while being energy efficient. The modular nature of MagicMirror² means I can easily add or remove features as I see fit, making it a flexible solution for my needs.

Overall, the Magic Table is a blend of practicality and tech experimentation. It’s not just about having a cool gadget; it’s about exploring how technology can enhance our daily lives in subtle ways.
