*Live* Template addresses a common challenge in software development: the struggle of generating a project from a template once and then keeping it up to date. While initial project setup using templates can save time, these templates often become outdated as best practices evolve and dependencies change. Live Template offers a solution by providing a command-line interface tool that not only streamlines the creation of React project templates but also allows for easy updates to existing projects. Built with Node.js and seamlessly integrating with React, this tool enables developers to maintain consistency across projects and effortlessly incorporate the latest improvements and security updates, eliminating the tedious process of manually updating multiple projects when template changes occur.
