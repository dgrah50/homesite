## Contributions to OpenReplay

### What is it?

OpenReplay is an open-source session replay suite for developers.

### My Contributions

I contributed to OpenReplay by enhancing its core functionalities and fixing bugs. My work involved improving the efficiency of session recording and playback, adding new features to the dashboard, and optimizing the performance of the JavaScript and TypeScript codebase. These contributions helped in making the tool more robust and user-friendly.
