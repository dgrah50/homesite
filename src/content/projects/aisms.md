AISMS is an AI-powered SMS system that uses machine learning to classify and respond to text messages.

AISMS leverages Python and machine learning algorithms to process incoming SMS messages and generate appropriate responses. The system can be trained to recognize various patterns in messages, enabling it to provide contextually relevant replies. This tool is useful for automating customer service, managing large volumes of messages, and ensuring prompt communication.


### Technical Implementation

AISMS is built using a modern Python stack, leveraging several powerful libraries and frameworks to create a robust AI-powered SMS system. Here's an overview of the key components and their roles in the project:

1. **FastAPI and Uvicorn**: The core of the application is built on FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python. Uvicorn serves as the ASGI server, providing high-performance handling of requests.

2. **Twilio**: This library is used to interface with the Twilio API, enabling the sending and receiving of SMS messages programmatically.

3. **LangChain**: LangChain is employed for natural language processing tasks, likely used in conjunction with OpenAI's language models (via `langchain-openai`) to generate contextually relevant responses to incoming messages.

4. **SQLModel and Tortoise ORM**: These libraries are used for database operations, with SQLModel providing a SQL database interface and Tortoise ORM handling asynchronous ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) operations. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of message data and user information.

5. **Google Maps**: The inclusion of the `googlemaps` library suggests that the system may incorporate location-based services or geocoding capabilities in its responses.

6. **Aerich**: This tool is used for database migrations, allowing for easy management of database schema changes as the project evolves.

7. **AsyncPG**: An asynchronous PostgreSQL database driver, indicating that the project uses PostgreSQL as its database backend.

8. **Python-dotenv**: Used for managing environment variables, crucial for keeping sensitive information like API keys secure.

The project structure follows best practices for Python development:

- It uses Poetry for dependency management and packaging.
- Ruff and MyPy are employed for linting and type checking, ensuring code quality and consistency.
- The application is configured to run asynchronously, as evidenced by the use of FastAPI, Uvicorn, and asynchronous database drivers.

The implementation follows these steps:

1. Incoming SMS messages are received via a Twilio webhook, handled by a FastAPI endpoint.
2. The message content is processed using LangChain and potentially OpenAI's language models to understand the intent and generate an appropriate response.
3. Any necessary data is stored or retrieved from the PostgreSQL database using Tortoise ORM.
4. If required, additional services like Google Maps might be queried to enrich the response with location-based information.
5. The generated response is sent back to the user via Twilio's SMS API.

This architecture allows AISMS to handle a high volume of incoming messages efficiently, process them with advanced AI capabilities, and provide quick, contextually relevant responses, all while maintaining a scalable and maintainable codebase.
