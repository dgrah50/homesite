AISMS is an AI-powered SMS system that uses machine learning to classify and respond to text messages.

AISMS leverages Python and machine learning algorithms to process incoming SMS messages and generate appropriate responses. The system can be trained to recognize various patterns in messages, enabling it to provide contextually relevant replies. This tool is useful for automating customer service, managing large volumes of messages, and ensuring prompt communication.
