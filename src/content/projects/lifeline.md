A low-cost remote patient monitoring system.

### More Info

LifeLine is a low-cost Internet-of-Things vital sign monitor with real-time illness prediction, allowing doctors to remotely monitor several patients in different locations. Custom circuitry interfaces sensors to measure vital signs with any Raspberry Pi. Sensor data is displayed live on a bedside monitor and live-streamed to a cloud-based database. A web app enables doctors to monitor patients live and view patient history. Data is processed by a machine learning algorithm to detect and predict critical events. The website uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, while the backend employs Googleâ€™s Firebase RealTime Database and Firebase Authentication.
