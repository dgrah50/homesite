Speech2Speech Summarizer uses Python and advanced machine learning techniques to transcribe spoken language into text and then summarize it. The system leverages natural language processing (NLP) to accurately capture and condense spoken content. It is designed for applications like meeting summarization, lecture transcription, and other scenarios where concise, accurate summaries of spoken content are valuable.
