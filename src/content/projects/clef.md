## Clef

### What is it?

Clef is a platform to buy and sell shares in music artists. I built their landing page and defined the tech specs for the app that they are currently building.

### More Info

Imagine investing in an artist before they make it big. Clef allows artists to raise capital without signing restrictive record deals. Inspired by Kanye West's remarks on artist rights, Clef offers music lovers the chance to invest in emerging talents. The landing page was built with Webflow, and the app, which is under construction, will be built with Flutter. Due to regulatory reasons, I have stepped back from this project.
