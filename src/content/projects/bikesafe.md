BikeSafe aims to improve recovery rates for stolen bicycles. The prototype, installed in the seat tube, uses GPS and accelerometer data to detect theft. GSM communication sends alerts to the userâ€™s phone, and an app overlays the bike's location data on a map. The project includes a custom Android app for tracking, which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/rahulberry/BikeSafe).
