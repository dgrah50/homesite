An e-commerce site built with React and Redux on the frontend and F# on the backend.

This project was a challenge to see if I could make a REST API in a functional language, choosing F# with the Giraffe web framework. The backend uses a NoSQL database in MongoDB to store item details. On the frontend, React with Redux is used for state management. This project helped me learn state management in a functional programming context.
