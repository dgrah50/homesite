### More Info

The EEERover is a rugged-terrain rover developed as part of a university project. It detects various signals (infrared, RF, acoustic) and relays information via wifi to a mobile phone. The project uses an ESP8266 IoT platform, custom PCBs, and an H-bridge motor controller. The rover can detect radio signals, ultrasound signals, infrared pulses, and magnetic fields. The ESP8266 module is programmed with C++ code through the Arduino interface.
