A productivity note-taking Chrome extension.

Gyst is a Chrome extension designed to enhance productivity by offering streamlined note-taking capabilities directly within the browser. It allows users to quickly capture and organize notes while browsing the web, providing easy access to important information without leaving the current page. The extension supports tagging, categorization, and quick search functionalities to help manage and retrieve notes efficiently.


### Key Features

1. **Website Blocking**: Gyst includes a powerful website blocking feature to help users stay focused and avoid distractions. Users can set up custom block lists and schedules to prevent access to time-wasting websites during work hours.

2. **All-in-One Productivity Suite**: Beyond note-taking, Gyst serves as a comprehensive productivity tool, offering multiple features in a single extension:

   - **Year Progress Toolbar**: A visual representation of the current year's progress, helping users maintain a sense of time and motivation.
   
   - **Journal Function**: An integrated journaling tool allows users to maintain daily logs, reflect on their thoughts, and track personal growth directly within the browser.
   
   - **Todo List**: A built-in task management system enables users to create, organize, and track their to-do items, ensuring important tasks are always at their fingertips.

3. **Seamless Integration**: All these features - note-taking, website blocking, year progress tracking, journaling, and task management - are seamlessly integrated into a single, user-friendly interface, making Gyst a true one-stop shop for productivity within the Chrome browser.
