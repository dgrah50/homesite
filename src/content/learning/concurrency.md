description: "the art of doing many things at once"

In all honesty - I spend the majority of my days working with high-level scripting languages (e.g JS / Python). I rarely get the chance to look at low-level languages and to me concurrency seems like a dark art. Given that I lack a traditional CS education, I have long been wanting to play catchup and read more about concurrency.
