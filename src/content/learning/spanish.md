### Why I want to learn about it?

Growing up in Britain, like many of peers from Britain, I speak one language only :( . When I reached university and made friends from different corners of the Earth speaking 2, 3, 4, 5+ languages, I realised just how much I am missing out on! Whilst I was alright at German at school, achieving an A* at GCSE, I realised that I want to start again in a new language. I would love to gift my unborn child with the privilege of speaking more than one language - so I have to start learning now. 

### How I am learning it currently
Over the past 2 or so months that I've been learning with a private tutor, it's been fantastic and I plan to continue. Also, revision of handwritten notes with ChatGPT has been amazing. [Ella Verbs](https://ellaverbs.com/) has been amazing for learning conjugation and [Madrigal's Magic Key to Spanish](https://amazon.co.uk/Madrigals-Magic-Spanish-Margarita-Madrigal/dp/0385410956) has been fantastic for showing me just how much vocabulary in Spanish I already knew.
