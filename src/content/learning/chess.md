## chess

### Why I want to learn about it?

It's a new game for me! I'm gonna suck at it and I'm gonna lose a lot! Too frequently I gravitate towards the things I am good at and I think it will be beautiful to practice some childlike humility and just be a noob at something again. For a long time before I started playing poker, I would see friends play and skip out on good times because I didn't want to commit time to learning a new game. In reality I was scared of not being good at something! I hope to just give chess a shot and put my ego to the side.

### Resources I plan to check out
